# Frameworks for Interpretation


## 1. Relational Coordination (RC) Lens
Emphasizes shared goals, shared knowledge, and mutual respect in teamwork.
- **Shared Goals:** Participants mention aligning human and AI objectives.  
- **Shared Knowledge:** Understanding what each party (human/AI) contributes.  
- **Mutual Respect:** Recognition of human dignity and capability alongside automation.

## 2. Critical Disability Lens
Ask how technology reproduces or disrupts structural inequalities.
- Does AI reinforce ableist assumptions?
- Who benefits or is excluded?
- What accessibility needs emerge?

Use these frameworks during thematic synthesis or memoing to move from *what* participants said to *why it matters*.
