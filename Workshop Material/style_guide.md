# Style Guide for Qualitative Outputs

## Coding Summaries
- Use **neutral, analytic language** (avoid speculation).
- Write in **present tense** (“Participants describe…”, not “They described…”).
- Include **verbatim quotes** (1–3 sentences) with participant ID in parentheses.

**Example:**
> Participants frequently adjust their reliance on AI tools based on perceived accuracy.  
> “I only trust it when it matches my gut feeling” (P3).

## Analytic Memos
Each memo follows this structure:

1. **Observations** – concise description of coded patterns.  
2. **Interpretation** – what these patterns suggest conceptually.  
3. **Connections** – link to frameworks (MERIT, RC, etc.).  
4. **Disconfirming Evidence** – highlight contradictions.  
5. **Implications** – practical or theoretical take-aways.  
6. **Reflexivity Note** – researcher’s position, feelings, or assumptions.

## Tone & Formatting
- Academic yet conversational (as in qualitative research articles).  
- Use Markdown headings and bullet lists.  
- Bold framework names and italicize in-vivo codes or key phrases.  
- Maintain inclusivity and respectful phrasing (avoid deficit framing).

## Output Conventions
- **Coded Segments:** JSONL or CSV; each line = one segment.  
- **Memos & Summaries:** Markdown.  
- **All outputs** end with a short *Reflexivity Note*.
