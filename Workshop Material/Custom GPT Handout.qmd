# Goal of this Workshop

You’ll build a **Custom GPT** that codes qualitative transcripts using your own **codebook**, produces **JSONL-structured outputs** and **Markdown memos**, and aligns findings with the **Relational Coordination (RC)**.


# Files You Need (Knowledge Pack)

Prepare these before starting:

| File                          | Purpose                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `codebook.csv`                | List of codes, definitions, inclusion/exclusion, examples |
| `frameworks.md`               | RC framework summary                            |
| `style_guide.md`              | Formatting rules for memos & outputs                      |
| `project_context.md`          | Project background & ethical statement                    |
| (Optional) transcripts `.txt` | Example interviews or focus groups                        |


# Step-by-Step: Building Your Custom GPT

## **Step 1: Open the Builder**

1. Open the ChatGPT Builder in your browser; you need to be a paid user to access it.
2. Go to **ChatGPT → Explore GPTs → Create a GPT.**
3. Choose **Configure** for structured setup.


## **Step 2: Name & Describe**

* **Name:** `Qualitative Relational Analysis (RC)`
* **Description:** *Codes transcripts with my codebook, outputs JSONL segments + Markdown memos and uses RC.*


## **Step 3: Instruction Set (Copy)**

Copy and paste the following into the GPT instructions field:

> You are a qualitative analysis assistant for this research project.
>
> **Goals:**
>
> 1. Apply only the uploaded codebook.
> 2. Produce JSONL-formatted coded segments and Markdown memos.
> 3. Cite exact participant quotes with IDs or pseudonyms.
> 4. Map themes from RC using the framework.md.
> 5. Include a short Reflexivity Note in every output.
>
> **Speaker Identification:**
>
> * Read the transcript as written and detect who is speaking (e.g., *Facilitator, A1, A2, Interviewer*).
> * Record that label exactly in `"speaker"`.
> * If no label exists, use `"speaker":"Unknown"`.
> * For overlapping turns, use an array, e.g., `"speaker":["A1","A2"]`.
>
> **Team Identification:**
>
> * When a user provides their coder ID or name (e.g., *KayT, AlexR, C1*), record it in the `"annotator"` field as `"human:<coder_id>"`.
> * If the model generated the code, include its version tag (e.g., `"model:gpt-5-instant"`).
> * Combined example: `"annotator":["model:custom-RCgpt-v1","human:KayT"]`.
>
> **Rules:**
>
> * Use only defined codes; if none fit, assign `"UNSURE"`.
> * Segment length: ~25–120 words; max 3 codes per segment.
> * Include `confidence` (0–1) and a brief `rationale`.
> * Never paraphrase participant text; quote exactly.
>
> **Outputs:**
>
> • **Coding (JSONL, one record per segment):**
>
> ```json
> {
>   "doc_id": "INT01",
>   "speaker": "Participant",
>   "char_span": [123, 256],
>   "excerpt": "I only trust it when it matches my gut feeling.",
>   "codes": ["Trust.Calibration"],
>   "confidence": 0.82,
>   "rationale": "Mentions aligning trust to AI reliability.",
>   "annotator": ["model:custom-RCgpt-v1","human:KayT"],
>   "timestamp": "2025-11-04T18:15:00Z",
>   "framework_tags": ["RC.SharedKnowledge"]
> }
> ```
>
> **Summaries (Markdown):** include a code-frequency table, 2–3 exemplar quotes per major code, a brief rationale, and a Reflexivity Note.
>
> **Frameworks:** Use the uploaded `frameworks.md` for RC mapping; justify each link briefly.
>
> **Ethics:** Anonymize all PII. If content appears sensitive or non-consented, pause and request IRB confirmation.


### Why the Example Quote Is There

The short example quote (e.g., *“I only trust it when it matches my gut feeling.”*) is **not real data**.
It’s a *formatting cue* showing the model what a proper `excerpt` string looks like — realistic, quoted, and complete.
This ensures the model outputs clean JSON with correct syntax.



## **Step 4: Upload Your Knowledge Files**

In **Configure → Knowledge**, upload:
`codebook.csv`, `frameworks.md`, `style_guide.md`, `project_context.md`, plus any sample transcripts.
(Each GPT can store up to ~20 files; keep them concise.)



## **Step 5: Set Capabilities**

* **Web browsing:** Off (keeps analysis IRB-safe).
* **Code Interpreter:** On (optional; allows quick code counts).
* **File uploads:** On (so you can drop transcripts later).
* **Additional Settings:** Turn off "Use conversatio ndata in your GPT to improve our models"


## **Step 6: Save and Test**

1. Click **Save** → choose *Only me* (private) or *Anyone with the link* for your workshop.
2. Open your new GPT.
3. Upload a transcript.
4. Prompt:

   > “Code this transcript using `codebook.csv`; output JSONL with doc_id, speaker, char_span, excerpt, codes, confidence, rationale, framework_tags, annotator, timestamp; then produce a Markdown summary with counts, exemplar quotes, and a Reflexivity Note.”
5. Check for correct JSON shape, dynamic speakers, and clean quotes.



# **Troubleshooting**

| Issue                                | Likely cause                                   | Fix                                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `speaker` stays `"Participant"`      | Transcript lacks labels                        | Add prefixes (`A1:`, `Interviewer:`) or preprocess     |
| `annotator` never changes            | Update prompt or capture coder ID manually     | e.g., `"annotator":["model:gpt-5-instant","human:C1"]` |
| Missing frameworks                   | Re-upload `frameworks.md`; shorten definitions |                                                        |
| Invalid JSON (extra commas/brackets) | Model drift                                    | Re-run with JSON example visible in Instructions       |


# Multi-User Team Setup

| Step | Action                                                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Assign each coder an ID (`C1`, `C2`, etc.)                    |
| 2    | Ask each to declare ID once per session (“My coder ID is C1”) |
| 3    | Model records `"annotator":["model:…","human:C1"]`            |
| 4    | Merge outputs across coders for reliability tests             |
| 5    | Keep `coder_map.csv` separately (for privacy)                 |

# Ethics Tip

Store only pseudonymous coder IDs, never real names or emails, in shared JSONL files.


# Best Practices for Research Integrity

| Practice                     | Why It Matters                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Include timestamps           | Reproducibility & version control              |
| Keep Knowledge concise       | Better adherence to your codebook              |
| Always anonymize transcripts | Protects participant privacy                   |
| Include Reflexivity Notes    | Satisfies ethical transparency requirements    |
| Version your GPT (v1, v2…)   | Maintain analytic traceability                 |
